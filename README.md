The aim of the project is to design and prototype robots, i.e., devices with sensors and actuators able to perform autonomous activity, that could engage people in public spaces such as shop windows, malls, stations, museums, and attract their attention to something that deserves it, like goods to be advertised, security ads, special displays, etc. New ways to attract attention and engage people distracting them from their activities are needed, and movable objects with sensors, such as the ones to be developed here, are one of the most interesting mean.
